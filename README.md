# FizzBuzz-PHP
FizzBuzz is one of the most commonly used interview questions for applicants to programming positions. Each interviewer has their own variant, but the prompt is usually something like:

Write code that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), except for these cases:
- If a number is a multiple of 3, write "Fizz".
- If a number is a multiple of 5, write "Buzz".
- If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, write "FizzBuzz".
